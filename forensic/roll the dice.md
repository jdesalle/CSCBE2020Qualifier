# roll the dice

We got a "post it" with different combinations of 5 number. Thinking about the title, we realised they could all be result of a dice roll, each number beeing between 1 and 6. 
After some research , we discovered "diceware" wich is a criptology method linking dice rolls to a worldlist to create a passphrase.

The transcription of the post it gave us "gab fuss whop chase guide stem", we can then mount the partition using this passphrase and get the flag.


note: the list we used for the diceware can be found at http://world.std.com/~reinhold/dicewarewordlist.pdf
