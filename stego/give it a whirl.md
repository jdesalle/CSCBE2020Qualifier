# give it a whirl

This file consist of binary text, we tried a lot of transformation on it (bin to ASCII, hedump, etc).

Finally, we realized that an esoteric language called "whirl" existed and its code use only binary character. By removing all spaces and puting it on a whirl IDE, we got the flag.

note: the IDE used in this challenge can be found at https://tio.run/#whirl
